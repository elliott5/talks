# Go Training day

The first part of the day will uses the Go Tour, an introduction to the Go programming language.

First [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install), taking care to set the environment variable GOPATH correctly for your system. 

Then install and run the tour locally:
```
	$ go get golang.org/x/tour/gotour
	$ cd $GOPATH/bin
	$ ./gotour
```

The second part of the day has some exercises, before the training day please:

$ go get github.com/elliott5/talks/2015/norwich
$ go get github.com/koyachi/go-nude
$ go get github.com/go-kit/kit
```

## Note: Please do not look at the solutions before you have attempted the exercises.
