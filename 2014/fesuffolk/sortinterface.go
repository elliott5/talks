package sort

// A type, typically a collection, that satisfies sort.Interface can be
// sorted by the routines in this package.  The methods require that the
// elements of the collection be enumerated by an integer index.
type Interface interface {
	// Len is the number of elements in the collection.
	Len() int
	// Less reports whether the element with
	// index i should sort before the element with index j.
	Less(i, j int) bool
	// Swap swaps the elements with indexes i and j.
	Swap(i, j int)
